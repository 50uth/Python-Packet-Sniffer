----- Server -----

 1. Socket object is created
 2. Bind socket to IP address and port
 3. Server can now listen/wait for connections
 4. Clients will attempt to connect, server can then accept connections

Once connection is made, server and client enter request/response (send/receive) loop
When connection is closed, server returns to listening state
